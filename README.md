Based on the summary results for this model, we can say that vehicle length, ground clearance, and the intercept have a statistically significant relationship among the 50 MechaCar prototype in our data set. This is based on a confidence level of < 0.05. However, we could not conclude a non-random relationship between gas mileage and vehicle weight, spoiler angle, and AWD (boolean). Based on a multiple R-squared value of 0.7149, this model explains roughly 72% of the variation in gas mileage among the 50 protoypes. With this, we can conclude that the model effectively predicts mpg of MechaCar prototypes, but with multiple 'insiginificant' variables, this model may be overfit for our data set.
